# Healthcare Management System â€“ SQL Database Design

This project contains the SQL schema for a **Healthcare Management System**, designed to manage core entities and relationships in a healthcare environment using relational database.

## What I Did

- Designed an **ER diagram** to model the key entities: `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Appointment`, `Room`, `Admission`, and `Bill`.
- Created SQL tables with:
  - **Primary keys** for unique identification.
  - **Foreign keys** to maintain referential integrity.
  - **Constraints** such as `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, and `CHECK`.
- Ensured the database schema supports real-world healthcare operations like booking appointments, patient admission, and billing.
